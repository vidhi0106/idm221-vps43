    <h2 class = "topic">User Pain Points</h2>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p class="sub-category">
            Created multiple wireframes to brainstorm different ideas and ways of portraying the interface. The task flow covers all the potential pages on the app. The aim was to best utilize the space to present all the necessary information in a way that did not feel overwhelming.

    <h2 class = "topic">Components</h2>
    <p>
        The thought behind the color scheme was to pick something fun and whimsical since the target users are mostly younger. Most of the components were built from scratch to inculcate micro-interactions in the design. A component library helped maintain consistency while designing across various screen sizes and pages.

        <h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
        <p class="sub-category">
            Mapping out the interaction flow on each page. The interactions are broken down into 4 parts - Triggers (actions that start a micro-interaction), Rules (conditions for the micro-interactions), Feedback (visual cue that alerts the user of the action taking place) and loops (repeatability of the micro-interactions) based on the categorization mentioned by Dan Saffer in his book 'Microinteractions'.

    </div>
    <h2 class = "topic">Interaction Guides</h2>
    <p>Created sketches to plan out the bigger micro-interactions. These guides helped make the ideas more concrete by going over the nuances and the state of the elements under different circumstances. </p>
    <img class="img" src="images/Group1.png" alt="Add to Bag inetraction">
    <p>
        After clicking the 'Add to Bag' button, the text disappears, the animation of a bag opening up comes up with a circle falling in it and the number of items in the bag shows up on the circle. 
    </p>
    <img class="img" src="images/Group2.png" alt="favorite inetraction">
    <p>
        After clicking the 'Favorite' button, the button will shrink and enlarge and the colors of the button will interchange with lines outside the button to resemble a heart popping.
    </p>
    <img class="img" src="images/Group3.png" alt="number slider/ remove inetraction">
    <p>
        When the number of items turn 0, the button turns into a 'Remove' button with a '+' on the side if the item was deleted accidentally. If the item is removed, the content is swished off the page. 
    </p>

        This credit card information micro-interaction builds the card as the information is entered and flips the card for the CVV and then flips it back again. Toggle key saves card information for future.

    <div class="Instyle">
        <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>
        <p>The high-fidelity prototype was created using the existing designs from Figma and editing them in Adobe AfterEffects to watch the micro-interactions play out in real-time. A user flow - buying a dress - is used to show the micro-interactions on the different pages. </p>
